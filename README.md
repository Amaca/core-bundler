## Getting Started

If you only want to use this webpack 5 configuration and dont want to know how to implement it, well just clone this repo and start develop.

1. `git clone https://github.com/amaca/core-bundler.git`
2. Navigate to folder you just clone
3. Install all Dependencies, `yarn` or `npm install`
4. Then for development just run the script `yarn start` or `npm run dev`
5. To build for production just run the script `yarn build` or `npm run build`, it will generate folder `build`.
6. To publish on your vercel app, run the script `yarn deploy` or `npm run deploy`, it will start the vercel deploy process.
